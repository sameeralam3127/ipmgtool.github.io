# IPMG

---

**IPMG (IP Management Tool)** is a modern, modular, enterprise-ready network scanner and monitoring utility.
It replaces the legacy `ip_pinger.py` script with a **clean package architecture**, CLI tooling, and automated workflows.

Designed for:

- Network administrators
- Systems engineers
- Cybersecurity teams
- DevOps and SREs

IPMG supports:

- **Subnet auto-discovery**
- **Parallel pinging with thread pools**
- **Hostname resolution**
- **Multi-format reporting (XLSX/CSV/JSON)**
- **Scheduled recurrent scans**
- **Auto-generated sample Excel input**
- **Colorized CLI output**
- **Modular testable architecture**

## ⚠️ Security Disclaimer

> **Do NOT use this tool on networks without explicit authorization.**
> Always obtain written approval from your organization's **Cybersecurity / Network Security team**.
> Unauthorized scanning may violate internal policies or law.

IPMG includes a built-in disclaimer shown at runtime (`security.py`).

| Use Case                        | Command                             | Description                                                                  |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Basic Example (Default Input)   | `ipmg`                              | Runs with default config. Creates `ip_list.xlsx` with sample IPs if missing. |
| Scan a Custom Input File        | `ipmg --input network_devices.xlsx` | Scans IPs from the specified Excel file.                                     |
| Auto-discover LAN Subnet        | `ipmg --discover`                   | Automatically detects and scans devices in the local subnet.                 |
| Export Results to CSV + XLSX    | `ipmg --formats csv xlsx`           | Exports scan results in CSV and Excel formats.                               |
| Resolve Hostnames (PTR Records) | `ipmg --resolve`                    | Performs reverse DNS (PTR) lookups for hostnames.                            |
| Run Every 10 Minutes            | `ipmg --interval 10`                | Repeats the scan every 10 minutes.                                           |

If `ip_list.xlsx` does not exist → it will be created with sample IPs.

# Troubleshooting

### **Command not found: ipmg**

Solution:

```
pip install -e .
```

### **Permission denied output folder**

Run inside a writeable directory or use:

```
sudo ipmg ...
```

### **Hostname Unresolvable**

Likely missing DNS PTR records.
